## How to Submit a Proposal

[TODO]

## Build a Team

As project manager, you can choose to submit either an individual or team project proposal. If your project requires a 
team of contributors then you will be responsible for choosing your own team. If you would like help with recruiting 
for any positions whether it is designers, developers, quality analysts, etc... please post the role you are looking for 
in the #recruiting channel on Slack and our team will help you find a contributor.

## Funding

In your proposal you will submit the funds requested along with a timeline for the project. After reviewing the 
proposal, we can collaborate on a roadmap including a set timeline with designated check-in dates. On each of these 
dates you will be responsible for providing an update on the current status of your project. If the project is going 
well and has not been abandoned, we will release the funds to your account.
