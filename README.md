## What You Will Be Responsible For

As project manager, you will be responsible for the following.

- Guiding the success of the project
- Building your team (we can help with recruiting)
- Managing all aspects of the project including planning, design, development, etcâ€¦
- Meet checkpoints according to your submitted roadmap timeline
- Maintain an active and happy team

## Build a Team

As project manager, you can choose to submit either an individual or team project proposal. If your project requires a 
team of contributors then you will be responsible for choosing your own team. If you would like help with recruiting 
for any positions whether it is designers, developers, quality analysts, etc... please post the role you are looking for 
in the **#recruiting** channel on Slack and our team will help you find a contributor.

## Funding

In your project proposal, you will provide the milestones for your project. After reaching each of your milestones you have to request funds by raising an issue. [Click here to Request Fund](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Project-Proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Request+Fund&template=request-fund.md&title=%5BFUND%5D+YOUR_PROJECT_NAME+-+MILESTONE+%28milestone+number%29)

You have to provide proof of the completion of that particular milestone in the issue. After verification, it will be labeled with the amount of fund that milestone is going to receive.

The amount of fund the project will receive after the completion of each milestone will be decided by the TNB team depending on how valuable and big the milestone is as well as the quality of work done to achieve that. That means, if your first milestone is getting UI/UX ready then your quality of UI/UX will be taken into consideration for the amount of fund you will receive.
