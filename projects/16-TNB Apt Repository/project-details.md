#### Project Repository

#### Issue
https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Project-Proposals/issues/16

#### How would you describe your project?
APT repository from which a user can install TNB's programs on Debian based Linux distro's

#### What problem does it solve?
It makes updating the application much easier, it makes TNB's programs more available and it's just going to be more organized.

#### Who is the target market?
Linux users running a Debian based distro.

#### What do you think is the opportunity of this project?
Gathering dependencies and updating the application will become easier for users, plus they won't have to execute an AppImage etc. every time but rather they can run a simple terminal command in order to start the application (it actually depends on the application). Agreed, shortcuts do exist but they are quite hectic in my opinion.

#### Are there any competitors?
We don't really have competitors.

#### How does it integrate with thenewboston digital currency work?
Makes the account manager etc. more accessible to Linux users.

#### Will you need specific information or advice?
Not really, if we face issues while debianizing projects, we will contact the people assigned to that project on assistance.

#### What are your goals and objectives?
Our goal is to centralize one place where Debian based distro users can get TNB applications etc. from.

#### How will you evaluate project success?
All planned packages to go on the repo work on all distro's support is given for.

#### What risks should you plan to manage?
Builds not working on some Linux distro's. We plan on doing tons of testing before pushing out builds, but in case we miss something, we will always be on the lookout for issues on the repo.
